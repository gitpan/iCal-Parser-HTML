NAME
    iCal::Parser::HTML - Generate HTML calendars from iCalendars

SYNOPSIS
      use iCal::Parser::HTML;
      my $parser=iCal::Parser::HTML->new;
      print $parser->parse(type=>$type,start=>$date,files=>[@icals]);

DESCRIPTION
    This module uses iCal::Parser::SAX and XML::LibXSLT with included
    stylesheets to generates html calendars from icalendars.

    The html document generated includes (when appropriate) a sidebar
    containing a legend, a list of todos and a three month calendar for the
    previous, current and next months.

    The stylesheets are stored in the HTML/stylesheet directory under the
    installed package directory.

    Also included in this package are an optionally installed command line
    program scripts and, in the example directory, a cgi handler (examples)
    and a stylesheet (examples) for formatting the html output. Note that
    the html output will look quite broken without the stylesheet.

ARGUMENTS
    The following arguments are processed by this module. Any addtional
    arguments are passed to iCal::Parser::SAX.

    type
        The type of calendar to generate. One of: `day', `week', `month' or
        `year'. The daily, weekly and monthly calendars include the sidebar.
        The calendar generated will be for the specified period (day, week,
        etc.) which includes the specified date.

    start
        The date to generated the calendar for. The date only needs to be
        specified to the precision necessary for the type of calendar. That
        is, `YYYY' for a yearly calendar, `YYYYMM' for a monthly, and
        `YYYYMMDD' for daily and weekly. In addition, the date can be in one
        of the following forms:

        YYYY[MM[DD]]
        YYYY[-MM[-DD]]
        A DateTime object initialized to the necessary precision
    files
        An array reference to the list of icalendars to include in the
        results.

    url If this params is specified, then the html output will contain links
        back to this url for getting other calendar periods. The params
        `type' and `date' will be appended to this url when generating the
        links.
